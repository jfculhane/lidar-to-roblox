# lidar-to-roblox
Experiments converting 3d Mac Iphone LiDAR scans to Roblox Game engine. 

See lidar-to-roblox-overview.png for recipe.
I'll post a video walkthough soon. 

The video refrences are out of the polycam software. There are two types:
- Orbit moves around the scene or object
- Path walks through the model 

You can download the reduced or decimated test scans from two expample folders:

blue-machine10k

chock10k

To see examples in Roblox ping my username tongueoftheviper on roblox and I'll send an invite.
