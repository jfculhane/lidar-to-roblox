# lidar-to-roblox
Experiments converting 3d Mac Iphone LiDAR scans to Roblox Game engine. 

See lidar-to-roblox-overview.png for recipe.

The video refrences are out of the polycam software. There are two types:
- Orbit moves around the scene or object
- Path walks through the model 

I did not name the indiviual .obj or .mtl files for now.

1-5-2022 - Added a cleaned up blender file of blue-machine model. Still need to lower the number of verticies < 10k
